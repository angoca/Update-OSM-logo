# Update-OSM-logo
This shows the steps to update the OSM Logo.

* 1: It starts with the original logo from the wiki: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Public-images-osm_logo.svg - 17:25, 23 November 2012
* 2: Converted to 96 dpi.
* 3: Removed unnecessary elements.
* 4: Binary numbers changed to represent OSM letters in binary.
* 5: Change the export directory and the title.
* 6: Recreated from scratch and copy all elements from the previous file. The file is much smaller than the first one (From 174714 to 95993).
