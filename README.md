# Update-OSM-logo
This shows the steps to update the OSM Logo.

* 1: It starts with the original logo from the wiki: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/File:Public-images-osm_logo.svg - 17:25, 23 November 2012
* 2: Converted to 96 dpi.
* 3: Removed unnecessary elements.
* 4: Binary numbers changed to represent OSM letters in binary.
* 5: Change the export directory and the title.
* 6: Recreated from scratch and all elements copied from the previous file. The file is much smaller than the first one (From 174714 to 95993).

It also includes the differences between each step except for the 6 which was recreated.
